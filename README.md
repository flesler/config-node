# Flexible lightweight configuration loader

## Installation

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/config-node.png?compact=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/config-node)

``` bash
$ npm install config-node
```

## Basic usage

```js
var config = require('config-node')();
console.log(config.server.port);
```

`config` will contain the contents of the configuration file named `process.env.NODE_ENV` or `'development'`, on the folder `config/`.<br />
It can be a JSON, a JS that fills `module.exports` or a directory with an index.js inside.

You probably noticed there's a function call in there. It needs to be added once to load the data. This is where you can put your options.
You'll probably do that on your main js file, in all the other ones you only require it:

```js
// in db.js
var config = require('config-node');
console.log(config.db.port);
```

## Options

These are the defaults:

```js
var config = require('config-node')({
	dir: 'config', // where to look for files 
	ext: null, // spoil the fun, tell me which one it is ('' for directory). Improves performance.
	env: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development' // set which one instead of smart defaults
});
```

In order to support more formats beyond json, js and directories. You add a file with a different extension to the config folder
and pass an option named as the extension with a function that takes the file string data and returns an object, synchronously!

```js
var config = require('config-node')({
	png: function(data) { return convertPNGtoObjectSomehow(data); }
});
```

- [lorenwest/node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) - Good, too complex for me. I'd never need things like file watching(use nodemon)
- [dominictarr/config-chain](https://github.com/dominictarr/config-chain) - Very cool one, too complex for most simple cases
- [dominictarr/rc](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc) - It's great, more oriented to loading files from outside the project
- [pgte/konphyg](https://github.com/pgte/konphyg) - Also great, but only JSON and does failed filesystem reads in most cases
- [scottmotte/dotenv](https://github.com/scottmotte/dotenv) - Loads environment variables from .env file directly into `process.env`
- Feel free to suggest others, these are the ones I found and used for inspiration

## Why use this project over others

- It's simple, the code is short and clean
- It's extensible, it can support coffee, yaml, ini or anything else you want, just DIY.
- It has no dependencies. If you need yaml, just include the one you prefer and pass it over.
- It's fast. Loading configuration needs to be fast, with the `ext` option this module is mostly a smart require.

## Some concepts taken into account

- [Convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration), tuned for the mayority.
- [Pareto principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). I aim for that 80% that needs only the 20% of the features.
- [KISS principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). It's really simple but it does the job.
- [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI). I prefer to add features based on requests.

## Tests

To run the test suite:

``` bash
$ npm test
